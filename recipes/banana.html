    <p>A creamy, sweet drink made from ripe bananas - perfect for breakfast or a quick snack. Let's put it this way, <strong>a banana smoothie is basically a banana in witness protection</strong> - it goes into the blender with its identity, comes out all sweet and unrecognizable, and everyone just happily drinks it without ever asking, "<em>Hey... weren't you a banana five minutes ago?</em>" 🍌🧋</p>
